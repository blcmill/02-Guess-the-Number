* While my program avoids using a "while" loop, it still functions identically to other similar programs and fulfills all assignment requirements.
* There are no runtime or compiler-time errors.  
* This program includes a "closeness" feature: the program lets you know when your guess is close to the actual number.
* This program also lets you know, if you lose, what the actual number was.
* This program also lets you know how many guesses you have remaining prior to every guess.

Guess the number! This is the second programming assignment for ILS-Z399. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "guess the number" game
* The program should randomly choose a number and then invite the user to guess the chosen number. 
* A game is only fun if it holds out a possibility for mastery, so the user will need to be given multiple chances to guess.
* Try to give the player useful feedback; you can decide how many chances the player will get.

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun.

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* Python [integers and strings](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html)
* How to [convert a string into an integer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/379906/parse-string-to-float-or-int)
* How to generate a [random integer](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html)
* How to use basic control structures like [if and else (and elif)](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/ifstatements.html)
* How to write a [for loop over a range](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
* How to [compare](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/comparison_operators_example.htm) two numbers in Python
* How to [accept user input](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/io.html)

I have given you a few lines of code to get started, but you will need to alter guess.py substantially to complete the assignment. Good luck!
